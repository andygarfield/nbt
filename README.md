# nbt
A Minecraft nbt decoder, encoder, and struct generator

Everything is a work in progress right now. The plan is to provide a struct is to expose `Marshal()` and `Unmarshal()`, as well as provide a struct generator (modelled after [gojson](https://github.com/ChimeraCoder/gojson)), so that you don't have to spend a ton of time creating types.
